# Pull requests are welcome

Each commit should demonstrates one idea. This is meant to be a learning
project, so each commit should teach one concept. Someone trying to learn
should be able to read commits one at a time to learn how to progressively
build the full implementation.

Any changes should include NUnit tests that demonstrate the capability being
added.
